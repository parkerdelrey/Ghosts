      <h1>Long Island is Very Haunted</h1>

      If you feel a chill in the New York air, it’s not just the winter weather. New York is the ninth most haunted state in the U.S. according to a recent survey by <a href="https://www.slotsource.com/haunted-hotspots">slotsource.com</a>. Within the
      state, a large majority of the ghost sightings submitted
      to Ghosts of America occur in Long Island – Nassau and Suffolk counties.

      Michael Cardinuto, founder of <a href="http://www.liparanormalinvestigators.com">Long Island Paranormal Investigators</a>, says that “there's a lot of history here.” According to Cardinuto and his colleague Dimitrios Haritos, the multitude of
      Native American tribes, battle sites from the American
      Revolution, and various urban legends, like the Amityville Horror House and the space/time rift formed during World War II’s Philadelphia Experiment, have created many hotspots on Long Island for hauntings.

      “These things create a – let's call it a cocktail for the paranormal. These are different events that have happened throughout the history of Long Island that have really just added to the myths and urban legends and tales and stories and
      ghosts,” Haritos says. “These traumatic events that happen, they leave a lasting effect on the environment around it.”
